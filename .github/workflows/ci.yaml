            # TODO: To reduce the cache size significantly, we might want to look into ensuring that
            #  GHC is not cached, since it is big and can be installed in couple of minutes.
            #  To do that, we will probably want to cache only ~/.stack/snapshots.

          #   This is not ideal for us, because we would ideally update cache even if it
          #   was fetched, because we want to cache any newly installed packages.
          #   This was working normally on Travis and Appveyor.
          #   There is an issue for this, and for now we are using proposed "fix" from it,
          #   https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/342#issuecomment-673371329,
          #   which mitigates the problem by creating new cache for each job and then using
          #   the feature of restore-keys which makes sure that next cache picked is the
          #   latest one. However, this keeps creating new cache each time which is not
          #   ideal because caches keep getting evicted, so for example if Win job
          #   fails multiple times while others don't, its cache will likely get evicted,
          #   making it even slower to test and fix (uffff).
