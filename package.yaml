synopsis:            Strongly typed paths in Haskell.
category:            System, Filesystem, FilePath

description:         Replacement for a FilePath that enables you to handle filepaths in your code in a type-safe manner. You can specify at type level if they are relative, absolute, file, directory, posix, windows, and even to which file or directory they point to or are relative to.

    # Those two are also tested in CI.
    # In case you decide to cover a different LTS with the lower bounds,
    # make sure to also update the CI to use the correct LTS for testing.
