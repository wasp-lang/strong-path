-- | Strongly typed file path. Central type of the "StrongPath".
--
--   [@s@]: __Standard__: Posix or windows. Can be fixed ('Posix', 'Windows') or determined by the system ('System').
--
--   [@b@]: __Base__: Absolute ('Abs') or relative ('Rel').
--
--   [@t@]: __Type__: File ('File') or directory ('Dir').
--
-- Some examples:
--
-- > Path System (Dir HomeDir) (File FooFile)
-- > Path System Abs (Dir HomeDir)
-- > Path Posix (Rel ProjectRoot) (File ())

  = -- NOTE: Relative paths can be sometimes be tricky when being reasoned about in the internal library code,
    --   when reconstructing them and working with them, due to RelPathPrefix and edge cases like ".", "..".
    --
    --   For example if original relative path was "..", we will parse it into RelDir "." ParentDir 1.
    --   Then it is important to be aware that this should be regarded as "..", and not "../.".
    --   In some functions like `basename` it is important to be aware of this.
    --
    --   Also, Path.Path can't hold empty path, so we can count on paths not to be empty.
    --
    --   And Path.Path can't store "." as file, only as dir, so that is also good to know.
    --
    --   I wonder if we could find a better way to represent path internaly, a way which would encode
    --   tricky situations explicitly, or maybe some kind of lower-level interface around it that would encode
    --   things like "paths can't be empty", "dir can be '.' but file can't", and similar.
    --   But maybe the solution would just be too complicated.

-- | Describes 'Path' base as relative to the directory @dir@.
data Rel dir deriving (Lift, Data)

-- | Means that path points to a directory @dir@.
-- To use as a type in place of @dir@, we recommend creating an empty
-- data type representing the specific directory, e.g. @data ProjectRootDir@.
data Dir dir deriving (Lift, Data)

-- | Means that path points to a file @file@.
-- To use as a type in place of @file@, we recommend creating an empty

data File file deriving (Lift, Data)

-- | Describes 'Path' standard as posix (e.g. @\/path\/to\/foobar@).
-- This makes 'Path' behave in system-independent fashion: code behaves the same
-- regardless of the system it is running on.
-- You will normally want to use it when dealing with paths from some external source,
-- or with paths that have explicitely fixed standard.
-- For example, if you are running your Haskell program on Windows and parsing logs which
-- were obtained from the Linux server, or maybe you are parsing Javascript import statements,
-- you will want to use 'Posix'.
data Posix deriving (Lift, Data)

-- | Describes 'Path' standard as windows (e.g. @C:\\path\\to\\foobar@).
-- Check 'Posix' for more details, everything is analogous.
data Windows deriving (Lift, Data)

-- | Describes 'Path' standard to be determined by the system/OS.
--
-- If the system is Windows, it will resolve to 'Windows' internally, and if not,
-- it will resolve to 'Posix'.
--
-- However, keep in mind that even if running on Windows, @Path Windows b t@
-- and @Path System b t@ are still considered to be different types,
-- even though @Path System b t @ internally uses Windows standard.
--
-- You will normally want to use 'System' if you are dealing with the paths on the disk of the host OS
-- (where your code is running), for example if user is providing you with the path to the file on the disk
-- that you will be doing something with.
-- Keep in mind that 'System' causes the behaviour of 'Path' to be system/platform-dependant.
data System deriving (Lift, Data) -- Depends on the platform, it is either Posix or Windows.

-- | 'System' is the most commonly used standard, so we provide you with a type alias for it.

-- | When you don't want your path to be relative to anything specific,
-- it is convenient to use unit @()@.
