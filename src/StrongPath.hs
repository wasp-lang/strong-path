module StrongPath
  ( -- * Overview

    -- | This library provides a strongly typed representation of file paths, providing more safety during compile time while also making code more readable, compared to the standard solution ("System.FilePath").
    --
    -- Example of using "System.FilePath" vs using "StrongPath" to get the path to bash profile file (relative to the home directory):
    --
    -- > -- Using FilePath
    -- > getBashProfilePath :: IO FilePath
    --
    -- This leaves many questions open. Is returned path relative or absolute? If relative, what is it relative to? Is it normalized? Is it maybe invalid? What kind of separators (win, posix) does it use?
    --
    -- > -- Using StrongPath
    -- > getBashProfilePath :: IO (Path System (Rel HomeDir) (File BashProfile))
    --
    -- With StrongPath, you can read from type that it is relative to home directory, you are guaranteed it is normalized and valid, and type also tells you it is using separators of the OS your program is running on.
    --
    -- Some more examples:
    --
    -- > -- System path to "foo" directory, relative to "bar" directory.
    -- > dirFooInDirBar :: Path System (Rel BarDir) (Dir FooDir)
    -- > dirFooInDirBar = [reldir|somedir/foo|]  -- This path is parsed during compile time, ensuring it is valid.
    -- >
    -- > -- Absolute system path to "bar" directory. `Path'` is just alias for `Path System`.
    -- > dirBarAbsPath :: Path' Abs (Dir BarDir)
    -- > dirBarAbsPath = [absdir|/bar/|]
    -- >
    -- > -- Absolute path to "foo" directory, calculated by concatenating two paths from above.
    -- > -- If path on the right was not relative to the path on the left, StrongPath would throw compile error upon concatenation.
    -- > dirFooAbsPath :: Path' Abs (Dir FooDir)
    -- > dirFooAbsPath = dirBarAbsPath </> dirFooInDirBar
    -- >
    -- > -- Posix path to "unnamed" file, relative to "foo" directory.
    -- > someFile :: Path Posix (Rel FooDir) File ()
    -- > someFile = [relfileP|some/file.txt|]
    -- >
    -- > dirHome :: Path System Abs (Dir HomeDir)
    -- > dirHome :: [absdir|/home/john/|]
    -- >
    -- > dirFooCopiedToHomeAsInBar :: Path System Abs (Dir FooDir)
    -- > dirFooCopiedToHomeAsInBar = dirHome </> castRel dirFooInDirBar
    -- >
    -- > data BarDir  -- Represents Bar directory.
    -- > data FooDir  -- Represents Foo directory.
    -- > data HomeDir -- Represents Home directory.
    --
    --
    --
    -- Basic idea is that working with 'FilePath' (which is just an alias for String
    -- and is a default type for representing file paths in Haskell) is too clumsy
    -- and can easily lead to errors in runtime, while those errors could have been caught
    -- in the compile time if more advanced approach for representing file paths was used.
    --
    -- This is where "StrongPath" with its 'Path' type comes in: by encoding
    -- more information about the file path into the type (e.g. is it relative or
    -- absolute, if it is relative what is it relative to, is it file or dir), we
    -- can achieve that additional safety and catch many potential errors during compile time,
    -- while also making code more readable.
    --
    -- Some examples:
    --
    --  - If you have absolute path to directory on the disk such as @\/home/\john\/Music@,
    --    with "StrongPath" you could represent it as @Path System Abs (Dir MusicDir)@,
    --    capturing its details in the type.
    --
    --  - If you have relative (to home) path to file on the disk such as @john\/.gitconfig@,
    --    you could represent it as @Path System (Rel HomeDir) (File JohnsGitConfigFile)@.
    --
    --  - If you have @..\/index.js@ path, coming from the Javascript import statement
    --    @import Stuff from \"..\/index.js\"@, you could represent it as
    --    @Path Posix (Rel ()) (File IndexFile)@.
    --
    --
    -- Notice that "StrongPath" will not allow you to, for example, represent @\/foo\/bar.txt@, which is an
    -- absolute path, as @Path System (Rel SomeDir) (File BarFile)@, because the parser function (in
    -- this case 'parseRelFile') will detect that path is absolute and not relative
    -- and will throw compile error.
    -- Therefore, due to the checks that parser functions perform,
    -- once you get 'FilePath' converted into 'Path', you can be pretty sure that it
    -- is exactly what the type says it is.
    --
    -- Once you have your file path represented as 'Path', you can perform safe operations like
    -- `</>` (concatenation of two paths) where types really shine.
    -- Specifically, `</>` will allow you to concatenate two paths only if they use the same standard,
    -- right path is relative to the left path and the left path is a directory.
    -- If these conditions are not satisfied, the code will not compile!

    -- ** Function naming

    -- | In "StrongPath" you will find groups of (usually 12) functions that all do the same thing really
    -- but each one of them is specialized for specific type of path.
    --
    -- In such case, we usually name them via following scheme: @\<function_name_prefix\>\<base\>\<type\>\<standard\>@, where
    --
    --  - @\<base\>@ can be @Rel@ or @Abs@.
    --  - @\<type\>@ can be @File@ or @Dir@.
    --  - @\<standard\>@ can be @P@ (Posix), @W@ (Windows) or nothing (System).
    --
    -- This results in 12 functions, for all 12 combinations of path type.
    --
    -- For example, from their name, we can say for the following functions that:
    --
    --  - @parseAbsFile@ does something with @Path System Abs (File f)@
    --  - @parseRelFileP@ does something with @Path Posix (Rel r) (File f)@
    --  - @parseRelDirW@ does something with @Path Windows (Rel r) (Dir d)@

    -- ** Common examples

    -- | Below we will go through most important features of "StrongPath" by going through some simple code examples that build upon each other.

    -- *** Typical import

    -- |
    -- > import StrongPath (Path, System, Abs, Rel, File, Dir, (</>))
    -- > import qualified StrongPath as SP

    -- *** Absolute path to home dir

    -- |
    -- Let's say that you want to ask user for absolute path to their home directory.
    -- With "StrongPath", you could do it like this:
    --
    -- > data HomeDir
    -- >
    -- > getHomeDirPath :: IO (Path System Abs (Dir HomeDir))
    -- > getHomeDirPath = getLine >>= fromJust . SP.parseAbsDir
    --
    -- Notice how you captured all the important information in type, plus
    -- you ensure it is indeed valid path by parsing it (with 'parseAbsDir')!
    --
    -- For the simplicity we didn't handle error properly and just used 'Data.Maybe.fromJust',
    -- but normally you would probably want to do something more fancy.

    -- *** Relative path to .gitconfig

    -- |
    -- Next, let's write a function that asks user for a relative path to .gitconfig file in their home directory.
    --
    -- > data UserGitConfig
    -- >
    -- > getUserGitConfigPath :: IO (Path System (Rel HomeDir) (File UserGitConfig))
    -- > getUserGitConfigPath = getLine >>= fromJust . SP.parseRelFile

    -- *** Absolute path to .gitconfig

    -- |
    -- If user inputed both abs path to home dir and rel path to .gitconfig, we can
    -- compute abs path to .gitconfig:
    --
    -- > absHomeDirPath <- getHomeDirPath
    -- > relGitConfigPath <- getUserGitConfigPath
    -- > let absGitConfigPath = absHomeDirPath </> relGitConfigPath
    --
    -- Cool thing here is that you can be sure that @absGitConfigPath@ makes sense, because '</>' would not allow
    -- you (at compile time) to concatenate @relGitConfigPath@ with anything else than path to home dir, since it knows
    -- that is what it is relative to!

    -- *** Copying .gitconfig

    -- |
    -- Let's say that for some reason, we want to copy this .gitconfig to home dir of another user,
    -- and we want it to have the same relative position in that home dir as it has in the current home dir.
    --
    -- Let's assume we already have
    --
    -- > anotherHomeDir :: IO (Path System Abs (Dir AnotherHomeDir))
    --
    -- then we can do smth like this:
    --
    -- > let absAnotherGitConfigPath = anotherHomeDir </> (SP.castRel relGitConfigPath)
    --
    -- We used 'castRel' to "loosen up" @relGitConfigPath@'s type, so it does not require to be relative
    -- to @HomeDir@ and instead accepts @AnotherHomeDir@.
    --
    -- Similar to 'castRel', there are also 'castFile' and 'castDir'.
    --
    -- Now we could do the copying like this:
    --
    -- > copyFile (fromAbsFile absGitConfigPath) (fromAbsFile absAnotherGitConfigPath)
    --
    -- Notice that while converting 'Path' to 'FilePath', we could have used 'toFilePath' instead of
    -- 'fromAbsFile', but 'fromAbsFile' gives us more type safety by demanding given 'Path' to be
    -- of specific type (absolute file). For example, if somehow variable @absGitConfigPath@ got to be of type
    -- @Path System (Rel ()) (Dir ())@, 'fromAbsFile' would cause compile time error, while 'toFilePath'
    -- would just happily go on.

    -- *** Extracting @from@ path from a JS import statement.

    -- |
    -- What if we wanted to extract @from@ path from a Javascript import statement and return it as a 'Path'?
    --
    -- Example of Javascript import statement:
    --
    -- > import Bar from "../foo/bar"  // We want to extract "../foo/bar" path.
    --
    -- Let's assume that we know that this statement is relative to some @ProjectDir@ (because that is where the
    -- JS file we got the statement from is located), but we don't know upfront the name of the file being imported.
    --
    -- Such function could have the following signature:
    --
    -- > parseJsImportFrom :: String -> Maybe (Path Posix (Rel (ProjectDir)) (File ()))
    --
    -- Notice how we used 'Posix' to specify that the path is following posix standard
    -- no matter on which OS we are running this code, while in examples above we
    -- used 'System', which meant paths follow whatever is the standard of the OS we are running on.
    --
    -- Next, also notice how we used @File ()@ to specify that file is \"unnamed\".
    -- While you could use some other approach to specify this, we found this to be convenient way to do it.
    -- That is why we also introduce @File\'@ and @Dir\'@ aliases, to make this even simpler.

    -- *** Defining a path via string literal during compile time

    -- |
    -- Let's say we want to define default file path from user's home directory to user's VLC config directory, and we already know it while writing our program.
    -- With "StrongPath", we could do it like this:
    --
    -- > defaultUserVlcConfigDir :: Path System (Rel UserHomeDir) (Dir UserVlcConfigDir)
    -- > defaultUserVlcConfigDir = [SP.reldir|.config/vlc|]
    --
    -- where we need QuasiQuotes language extension for 'SP.reldir' quasi quoter to work.
    -- This will parse the path during compile-time, ensuring it is valid.

    -- *** Paths starting with "../"

    -- |
    -- Relative paths in "StrongPath" can start with one or multiple "../".
    -- "../" is taken into account and appropriately managed when performing operations on paths.
    --
    -- > someRelPath :: Path System (Rel SomeDir) (File SomeFle)
    -- > someRelPath = [SP.relfile|../foo/myfile.txt|]

    -- ** Inspiration

    -- |
    -- This library is greatly inspired by [path library](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/path)
    -- and is really a layer on top of it, replicating most of its API and using it for implementation
    -- details, while also adding to it, with main additions being:
    --
    -- - Differentiation between path standards (system, posix and windows) at type level, they can't be accidentally mixed.
    -- - \"Naming\" of directories and files at type level.
    -- - Support at type level for describing what are relative paths exactly relative to,
    --   so you e.g. can't concatenate wrong paths.
    -- - Support for @..\/@ at start of relative path.

    -- ** StrongPath in practice

    -- |
    -- - "StrongPath" is used extensively in [wasp-lang](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/search?q=StrongPath).

    -- ** Similar libraries

    -- |
    -- - [path](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path) - Inspiration for StrongPath. Has less information encoded in types than StrongPath but is therefore somewhat simpler to use.
    -- - [data-filepath](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-filepath) - Similar to `path`. Check https://github.com/commercialhaskell/path#data-filepath for detailed comparison to `path`.
    -- - [pathtype](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pathtype) - Similar to `path`. Check https://github.com/commercialhaskell/path#pathtype for detailed comparison to `path`.
    -- - [paths](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/paths) - Focused on capturing if path is relative or absolute, and to what.
    -- - [hpath](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpath) - Uses ByteString under the hood (instead of String), written only for Posix, has no File/Dir distinction.
